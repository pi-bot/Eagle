#Making a Panel

To save costs and efficientcies I've decided to make one panle for all the products.

## Process
The important thing is to make all master edits on the individual designs. Creating a panel involves merging the individual designs where  net names will be altered. The combined panel design is used to export gerbers and the BOM for manufacture.

To start I used the most complex design. (3 schematic sheets).  Rename this pane.sch (panel.brd is also generated). The important step is to switch to board layout before going to file>import>EAGLE drawing...
Then selected the board file and the schematic should be imported as well.:)
